# Understanding computer emulation

This project takes you on the fast track, understanding the fundamental workings of a **computer**, a **compiler**, and a **debugger**, all within your browser! But first and foremost, we'll build a hassle-free computer emulator entirely in JavaScript, demonstrating core concepts like processing instructions, memory, and input/output, let alone the basics of emulation itself.  

**Understanding how to build computer emulators remains extremely valuable**.  Emulators are often disregarded as the architectural pattern for their acclaimed offsprings called virtual machines (VMs), cloud computing, containers, nodes, pods and many other derivatives.

Above and beyond retrocomputing, as popularised by nostalgic amateurs, the wider audience can also appreciate retrocomputing, merely as the key to understanding large bytes of poorly understood contemporary technology!

Whether one prefers to read instructions or watch the videos we recorded on this topic, they can help you understand the very basics of binary-logic-based computing, in other words, a [universal Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) based on the [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture).  While more advanced architectures exist as we speak, this one traces back to digital computing as it entered our households around 1980 and has ever since participated in our daily lives.  In this section, we will step-by-step build all the essential components that make a fully functioning computer.

## What You'll Learn

- Computer bits & pieces:
   - the system clock
   - the databus
   - memory (RAM/ROM)
   - I/O (memory-mapped)
   - CPU (instructions & program execution)
- JavaScript coding practice!

## Getting Started:

While this project starts from very simple code to gradually more complex, no additional software or server setup is required; just some basic understanding of JavaScript.  Download this project and start the emulators directly in your browser by clicking the local file **index.html**.  Alternatively, check out [index.html](https://BeyondRetrocomputing.github.io/emulator/) to run this project directly on GitHub.
All the JavaScript components can be found in the /res folder and can be opened using your favorite development environment (IDE) featuring basic JavaScript syntax highlighting.
